# Digital Signal Processing
This repository is a collection of the experiments I performed during my college laboratories of Digital Signal Processing. I built this repository as a humble and unpretentious effort to help students. 

It includes:
1. 4 point FFT in Matlab
2. 8 point FFT in Matlab
3. Auto Correction
4. Block Convolution using Overlap Add in Matlab
5. Block Convolution using Overlap Save in Matlab
6. Circular Convolution
7. Cross Correlation
8. Karl's Correlation
9. Linear Convolution
10. Sine Wave in Matlab
